# gtk4-demo-test
Personal project learning how to write a GUI program using GTK4.

Notes about some pitfalls I've encountered are in /notes.txt.

When you install the GTK4 dev package, it comes with a bunch of demo apps, and
you can access those demos from your Pi "start" menu (sorry) in the Programming
submenu.

One of those demo apps is called "Application Class" which appears to be the
simplest demo. This is the one I copied the code from, into this C project.
This will be just the demo, more or less untouched, that I can use as a
reference. More projects will be added which will actually try to modify the
demo..
